## Description🙈🙉🙊

Create an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application will use an express backend to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

## User Story👻
```
AS A user, I want to be able to write and save notes

I WANT to be able to delete notes I've written before

SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```
## Business Context

For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.
